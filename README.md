# Trapped-Ions-Quantum-Information-Group-ETHZ

The file in the repository is the report of the project conducted in the TIQI group at ETHZ. It describes the detection of neutral fluorescence of Beryllium-9. Not included in this report, I also developed and implemented the setup needed to upgrade my experiment, substituting the effusive oven with a Beryllium target to be ablated.
